# -Analyzing-the-teams-and-the-players-performance-In-the-Indian-Premier-League
Cricket is one of the most loved sports of the country and Indian Premier league is
one of the flagship sports leagues of India, garnering wide attention every year.
Every year the sports league is garnering more attention than before. This project is
an attempt to analyze the performance of the players and the teams in the Indian
premier league and understand the capabilities of various players.
The dataset used in the project has been exploited in the best way possible to
visualize it to the maximum extent. Django framework has been used in pycharm
IDE and the front end is constructed using html, css and javascript.
The dataset has been visualized in the form of piecharts, bar charts, boxplots, table
formats, line graphs.

Key words: Data set, Cricket, Performance, Players, Visualization

INTRODUCTION:

The Indian Premier League is conducted every year and the participating teams
represent a city in India. This is a professional Twenty-twenty cricket league that is
governed by the Board of Control of Cricket in India (BCCI). Various factors affect
the game like the skills of the players (like bowling rate, batting rate), their form, the
rules of the game and etcetera. Information visualization is a process of visualizing
the information in such a way that the information presented is accurate and easy to
understand.

Bar charts help in representing the categorical data using rectangular bars. They are
used to compare the items between different groups over time. Pie charts are graphs
that represent the data in the circular graph, the slices of pie show the relative size
of the data. Pie chart is said to be the pictorial representation of data. Box plot is a
measure of how well distributed the data is in a data set. It divides the data set into
three quartiles and represents the minimum, maximum and median, first quartile and
third quartile in the data set.

This project tries to visualize these important factors that determine the playerâ€™s real
position in the team using the visualizing techniques and above mentioned
visualization charts.
